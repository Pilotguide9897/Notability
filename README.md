A video illustrating this application's functionality may be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/HIwSCIZ18_U).

## Description
Notability is a simple and efficient web application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The application is built using Node.js and runs on an Express.js server. Notes are saved within a JSON file, and unique IDs are generated for each note using NodeJS' 'uuid' package. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The application is hosted using Heroku, allowing users access to the application through their preferred web browser so that they may manage their notes.

The deployed application may be accessed [here]().
